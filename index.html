                <h2>Blocker</h2>
                <p>Most of the players on the track are blockers. If no one is in the penalty box, each team fields four blockers during a jam.
                    <br>
                    <br>Primarily, a blocker's job is to work with their teammates to play defense, stopping the opposing team's jammer
                    from passing them and scoring points. Blockers also play offense, helping their own team's jammer get past the opposing blockers.
                    Good communication with fellow blockers is key!

                <h2>Pivot</h2>
                <p>A pivot is a blocker with a special role. Each team is allowed to field one pivot,
                    who is designated by the stripe on their helmet. At any time, a team's jammer may pass their star
                    to their pivot, who then becomes the new jammer. Pivots need both jamming and blocking skills,
                    as well as the awareness to know when their jammer might need help!

                <h2>Jammer</h2>
                <p>Each team fields one jammer, who is designated by the star on their helmet. The jammer's job is to score points
                    by passing the opposing team's blockers. Whichever jammer initially escapes the pack first gains the designation of 
                    "lead jammer," giving them the strategic advandage of being able to end the jam whenever they choose.
                    <br><br>A good jammer plays to their strengths, using a combination of speed, strength, agility, and creativity to get through any way they can!

                <h2>Referee</h2>
                <p>A fully staffed roller derby game requires seven skating referees. Each referee is given a designated position, and officiates the game from 
                    either the inside or outside of the track. There are even two jam refs, whose job it is to primarily watch their designated jammer.
                    <br><br>Referees have a tough job. They need to have the skating skills to keep up with the game, as well as an encyclopedic
                    knowledge of the rules and how to enforce them!
                </p>

                <h2>NSO</h2>
                <p>If you want to get involved without worrying about skates, there's a position for you! Non-skaing officials,
                    or NSOs, are essential to the game. NSOs have a variety of jobs, including penalty box timer,
                    jam timer, score keeper, and penalty tracker. A good NSO is organized and familiar with the rules. It takes a village to run a derby game!
